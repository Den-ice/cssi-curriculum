Git is a powerful version control tool for code. It lets you edit code with
confidence, knowing that you can rewind your changes if you need to. It is also
a widely used tool for collaboration.

Github is a free platform for hosting code repositories. Using git, developers
can share their code through Github, making it visible to the world and keeping
teams of developers in sync.
