# Recommendations for CSSI


## For setting up laptops:
+ create an image with everything installed, image all the laptops with it

## Curriculum Creation:
+ Never have more than one version of the files
+ Creating and editing curriculum in the same room is much better than over GVC.

## Curriculum Notes:
+ Don't cover Many to Many in class.  Its super confusing.
