# Recommendations for CSSI
The most up to date curriculum (August 2015) is the curriculum in the [github repository](https://github.com/google-cssi/cssi-curriculum).

Lead Instructors should be familiar with the whole curriculum - even if a module instructor will be covering the lectures, lead instructors should be able to help with bugs during exercises and project week.

## For setting up laptops:
+ create an image with everything installed, image all the laptops with it
+ The current tech assumptions:
  + Atom - open source text editor by Github
  + Python 2.7
  + git
  + Chrome
  + Google App Engine Launcher
+ Students will need a Github Account

## Curriculum Creation:
+ Never have more than one version of the files
+ Creating and editing curriculum in the same room is much better than over GVC.

## Curriculum Notes:
+ Don't cover Many to Many (Datastore relationships) in class.  Its super confusing and most student projects won't use it.
+ More time on CSS
