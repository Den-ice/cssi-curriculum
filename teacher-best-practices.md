# Best Practices for Teaching at CSSI
### Instructional Strategies

| Check for Understanding(CFU)|Checks for Understanding are pre-planned questions that assess whether students are understanding the material you present. Throughout your lesson plan questions to ask students to collect data on whether your students are understanding concepts in order to make real time decisions about moving forward or reteaching a concept. Distribution between students. Be willing to repeat material - don't wait before repeating a small chunk! |If the number 24 is in between “” is it consider a string or a number?

###Delivering content:

+ Why is your lesson important- Every lesson should start with a WHY. Why is this topic important, relevant and exciting?! Find ways to connect with student's background knowledge and every day life.
+ Chunking lectures- Stop after each new skill and ask the class to rank their understanding from 1-5 or show a thumbs up and thumbs down. Rule of thumb is with every new skill students should have at least 10 minutes of practice.
+ Talk aloud- When you are coding to talk through your thought process. When you run into an error DON'T PANIC, model debugging and searching for documentation.
+ Be creative about naming variables especially when data is being passed in multiple places rather than just using x and y.

```python  
def add (dog,cat):
  return dog + cat

platypus= 50
giraffe= 20

add (platypus,giraffe)
```

### Check for student understanding:

+ Fist to Five- Ask students how comfortable they feel by showing 1-5, one being they need help from a teacher, 3 being they need more practice, and 5 being they could teach this to another student. Consider introducing the eyes closed fist of five which can be more illuminating and helpful.
+ Awkward silence- After you ask a question, allow the silence to linger a little longer than is comfortable can get students to speak up. If no one speaks up that is a sign that the class didn't understand the concept. Go back and reteach the last skill.
+ Calling on Students- Avoid calling on the same students that always raise their hands. Call on quiet students with review questions, call on table teams to answer questions as a group, and have students turn to their partners to answer the question.
+ Affirm and Redirect- When students give the incorrect answer, acknowledge their answer is wrong but affirm their thought process. "That's not it, but I can see how you came up with that answer."
+ Loop back with students- When a student gets the wrong answer, feel free to ask another student but try to come back to the same student and ask the same question again to ensure they understand the concept.

###Individual lab work:

+ Don't give away the answer- Coach students towards answering their own question rather than giving them the answers. Encourage them to search online for documentation or direct them towards where their error message might be.

###Group work:

+ Have students pair program as much as reasonable. Half of the class has their laptops closed and students talk through their thoughts as they code. It works best if you explicitly assign partners for coding.

###Culture and motivation:

+ Encourage rubber ducky debugging. Have students explain their code before you giving trying to help find a solution to their code.

###Logistics:

+ Use the same technology and environment (editor, terminal, etc.) as the students
+ Incorporate live coding in your lessons when possible. Slides are great for reference but they should not be the majority of your lesson.
+ Practice with git and Github before project week. It's super helpful to be familiar with the bugs that students will see before they see them.
+ Begin each day with a review session or independent lab time.
+ Insist on organizing folder structures from day 1. When using Atom make sure to only have the file that is meant to be changed open.
+  Many students did not attend breakout sessions if they were phrased as review or beginners. Phrase breakout sessions to be topical rather than review/advanced
+ Develop a glossary for all the new terms students learn for each language. It can be a shared google doc or written on poster paper.
