# Best Practices for CSSI Curriculum

## Before CSSI
+ Practice with git and Github. It's super helpful to be familiar with the bugs that students will see before they see them. Project week in particular will be filled with merge conflicts.

## General Daily Practice

###Delivering content:
+ Why is your lesson important- Every lesson should start with a WHY. Why is this topic important, relevant and exciting?! Find ways to connect with student's background knowledge and every day life.
+ Chunking lectures- Stop after each new skill and ask the class to rank their understanding from 1-5 or show a thumbs up and thumbs down. Rule of thumb is with every new skill students should have at least 10 minutes of practice.
+ Talk aloud- When you are coding to talk through your thought process. When you run into an error DON'T PANIC, model debugging and searching for documentation.

###Check for student understanding:
+ Fist to Five- Ask students how comfortable they feel by showing 1-5, one being they need help from a teacher, 3 being they need more practice, and 5 being they could teach this to another student. Consider introducing the eyes closed fist of five which can be more illuminating and helpful.
+ Awkward silence- After you ask a question, allow the silence to linger a little longer than is comfortable can get students to speak up. If no one speaks up that is a sign that the class didn't understand the concept. Go back and reteach the last skill.
+ Calling on Students- Avoid calling on the same students that always raise their hands. Call on quiet students with review questions, call on table teams to answer questions as a group, and have students turn to their partners to answer the question.
+ Affirm and Redirect- When students give the incorrect answer, acknowledge their answer is wrong but affirm their thought process. "That's not it, but I can see how you came up with that answer."
+ Loop back with students- When a student gets the wrong answer, feel free to ask another student but try to come back to the same student and ask the same question again to ensure they understand the concept.

###Individual lab work:
+ Don't give away the answer- Coach students towards answering their own question rather than giving them the answers. Encourage them to search online for documentation or direct them towards where their error message might be.

###Group work:
+ Have students pair program as much as reasonable. Half of the class has their laptops closed and students talk through their thoughts as they code. It works best if you explicitly assign partners for coding.

###Culture and motivation:
+ Encourage rubber ducky debugging. Have students explain their code before you giving trying to help find a solution to their code.

###Logistics:
+ Use the same technology and environment (editor, terminal, etc.) as the students
+ Incorporate live coding in your lessons when possible. Slides are great for reference but they should not be the majority of your lesson.
+ Practice with git and Github before project week. It's super helpful to be familiar with the bugs that students will see before they see them.
+ Begin each day with a review session or independent lab time.
+ Insist on organizing folder structures from day 1. When using Atom make sure to only have the file that is meant to be changed open.
+  Many students did not attend breakout sessions if they were phrased as review or beginners. Phrase breakout sessions to be topical rather than review/advanced
+ Develop a glossary for all the new terms students learn for each language. It can be a shared google doc or written on poster paper.

=======
+ Use the same technology (editor, terminal, etc.) as the students
+ Every lesson should be accompanied by student practice - students should be coding for 5 - 20 minutes without any new lecture material after every new concept.
+ Incorporate live coding in your lessons when possible.
+ Have students pair program as much as reasonable. If half of the class has their laptops closed and students talk through their thoughts as they code, they will learn to communicate about programs *and* two pairs of eyes will catch many more bugs. Early on, it works best if you specifically assign partners for coding.
+ You do not need to answer a student's question to completion, or debug all the way - ask them what they ought to search online, or where they should look to find an error message. Tell them you'll check back in
+ As you code along, share your experience as a real engineer.
+ As you make mistakes, walk very slowly through your thoughts and process as you debug.
+ When you draw on knowledge that you've gained over the years, share where you learned that knowledge, and indicate whether it is something they should know or something they should forget and look up when they need it.

## Python

###Pacing and Order
+ Strings methods need to be taught before function labs because many function labs include string methods.

###Content
+ Math operators and string methods are boring to teach in isolation; they don't represent basic, reusable concepts but instead targeted solutions for particular problems.  For reference, structuring the material this way makes sense but for introducing them it makes more sense to not have the instructor present them but to have a guided lab introduce them.
+ One way to introduce loops, lists and conditionals is to using the running example of "print all the days in the year (Jan 1 .. Dec 31)" and then worked on simplifying that to introduce loops and lists (and then conditionals to get st/nd/rd/th suffixes).

###Instructional Delivery Methods
+ If the room allows, try to have the split screens: a terminal window (or reference slides) and an IDE atom window. If this isn't possible, consider sharing a Drive folder with the students so they could see the up-to-date code .
+ Use the whiteboard to draw out concepts. For example explain how a list is like a shelf of library books. Each book has a title and an index position.

###Labs
+ The calculator lab has been changed to “make your own 80’s console game”. Students had 60 mins, students presented their game, their code, what they learned, and what they would do with 10 more mins
+ We added a more pre-defined class practice
