The Computer Science Summer Institute is a three week program for rising college freshmen starting a degree in Computer Science or a related field. This site houses the curriculum for the three week course. Students will learn HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, and Google's App Engine Platform, and spend a week creating web applications in teams of three.

Anyone is free to use the curriculum in the classroom or to learn on their own - remember that it is written for the three-week intensive, so not everything will apply to you. Get in touch with <cssi@google.com>!
