  title: jQuery Animation Lab - When Pigs Fly
  language: jquery
---

Fork [this](https://github.com/google-cssi/cssi-3-jquery-animation-lab) repo on Github and clone these files onto your local machine. In the repo, there are some basic jQuery events in my_script.js, and a cute image of a pig in pig.html. We will use these files to create some jQuery animation.

# Step 1: Animate the Pigs when you Click the Button
Right now the pigs just disappear and reappear. You want them to fade, move, and zoom. Add a new button called "Fly" that makes the pig move.
* Check out the animate documentation to get this to happen.
* In CSS, make sure div is styled to have `position: absolute`.

# Step 2: Removing the Buttons
Use what you learned about jQuery events to have the pig "fly" when you click on the image themselves, not the button.

# Step 3: Add a New Pig
Modify the HTML to add a new pig *to the right* of your current pig. You might have to play around with the CSS layout properties.

# **Stretch:** Follow the Leader
Create an event where once the first pig flies away, the other one follows automatically after a set period of time.
