# Adding Templates to Fortune Teller

Now that you know how to render templates, you can start using your HTML skills to make the start of your html files.

You don't quite know how to make them dynamic - that is, recieve data from python, so for now include a default message as your fortune or 8 ball response.

Each template should include a title, at least one image, a default message and a link to the wikipedia article about each fortune-telling method.

Remember you'll need to add the jinja2 and webapp2 libraries in order to render templates.
