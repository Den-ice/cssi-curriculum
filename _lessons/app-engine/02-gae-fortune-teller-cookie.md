# Fortune Teller App
We are starting a Fortune Teller App that we will build on over the course of several exercises during the next two days At the end of these exercises you will have an App Engine application that performs [cold reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_reading) simulations.

Set up a basic application, then read the requirements below and implement the path as specified. Note that the requirements may be vague, ambiguous, or just incomplete. Think about how you are deciding between different ways of implementing things.

## Path 1:

### **Fortune Cookie**

Path: /fortunecookie

Requirements:

1. When a user goes to this path, they shall see an image of a fortune cookie and receive a random fortune. [What library will you need to import?]

2. There shall be at least ten different fortunes.
