* Add loop logic to your fortune cookie template so that
`http://localhost:8080/fortunecookie?/repeat=3` displays three cookies with three different fortunes


* Add a conditional statement to your 8 Ball template that changes if the 8 ball image is displayed.
`http://localhost:8080/8ball?/type=pos&img=no` Would display a positive answer with no 8 ball image.
