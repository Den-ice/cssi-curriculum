  title: Lab - Python Functions - FizzBuzz
  language: python
---

A classic programming problem is [FizzBuzz](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FizzBuzzTest). It is considered the [Stairway to Heaven](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/fizzbuzz-the-programmers-stairway-to-heaven.html) of programming because there are so many different ways to play it and everyone plays it.

The goal is to write a fizzbuzz function that takes a number parameter and has different output depending on the input. If the number is evenly divisible by 3, the function should return "Fizz"; if it's divisible by 5, return "Buzz"; if the input is divisible by both 3 and 5, the function should return "FizzBuzz".

Write a fizzbuzz function, and write a loop to test your function with the numbers between 1 and 100. Your output should look something like:

```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
...
98
Fizz
Buzz
```
