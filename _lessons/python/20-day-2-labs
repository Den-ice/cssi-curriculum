#  Day 2 Labs
To access these labs, click on their github links, and then fork and clone their repositories.

[NESTED-LISTS-DICTIONARIES] (https://github.com/google-cssi/cssi-4-python-nested-lists-dictionaries-lab)
lists inside of lists! dictionaries inside of dictionaries! lists inside of dictionaries! dictionaries inside of lists inside of dictionaries! Oh my!

[DICE ROLL LAB](https://github.com/google-cssi/cssi-5.4-python-dice-roll) [Methods, Loops, Conditionals]
It should roll two dice five times, printing the rolls of each pair. Look at the code and get familiar with it. You will modify this program in three ways.

[TIC-TAC-TOE](https://github.com/google-cssi/cssi-5-python-stretch-tictactoe-challenge) [ Functions, Algorithm]
Can you get this TIC TAC TOE game up to speed? How would you tell whether someone has won at a game of Tic Tac Toe? Open up <kbd>game_solution_detector.py</kbd> and fill in the missing pieces to get it working! Someone else has written a game.  Your job is to write some functions to see whether or not the game has been won, and who won.

[JUKEBOX LAB](https://github.com/google-cssi/cssi-5-python-jukebox-lab)[Functions, Loops, Console Input, Conditional Statements]
You're going to write a jukebox that introduces itself to the user and then asks for input. There are a number of ways to accept user input. As an example, let's build a program that asks a user for their name and says hello to that user using the gets command.

[PYTHONIC LANGUAGE](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/cssi-5-python-your-language)[Functions, Interpreter]
For this challenge, you are going to write an interpreter for your own programming language, called "Pythonic".

[ALICE IN WONDERLAND 1 STRETCH LAB](https://github.com/google-cssi/cssi-5-python-alice)[Functions, Algorithm]
Using the code snippet in alice.py as a starting point, analyze the text of Alice in Wonderland, in alice.txt, to determine how many unique words are in the book.

[ALICE IN WONDERLAND 2 STRETCH LAB](https://github.com/google-cssi/cssi-5-python-stretch-alice-challenge-2)[Functions, Algorithm]
Take the Alice in Wonderland exercise and start working on the two challenge problems there. Once you have a system for analyzing the properties of book-length texts and a system for generating random text based on those properties follow the steps of the lab.
