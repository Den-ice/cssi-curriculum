To access these labs, click on their github links, and then fork and clone their repositories.

[A Subway Story](https://github.com/google-cssi/cssi-4.8-subway-functions-lab) [Functions, Math Operations, Loops]
![subway balloons](http://1.media.collegehumor.cvcdn.com/28/26/beeb4cb32e3896b1659854ad8977c847-the-new-york-city-subway-what-you-can-expect.jpg)
Public Transit is always an adventure. This lab contains the frame of a variety of functions. Your job is to complete them so that when they are called at the bottom of the subway_functions.py file, you're ready to share your subway story.

[WALL-E](https://github.com/google-cssi/cssi-4-python-group-functions-conditionals-walle-lab) [String Methods, Functions, While and For Loops, Conditional Statements]
WALL-E's microphone is broken and the only way he can hear you is if you shout at him!! Write a `speak_to_walle` method that accepts one argument: what you want to say to him. Whatever you say (type) to WALL-E, he should respond with `Dirrrrr-ect-tivvve?`, unless you shout it (type in all capitals). If you shout, he can hear you and yells back, `EEEEEEEEEEEVAAAAAAAAAA!`.


[STRETCH: Cartoon Collections](https://github.com/google-cssi/cssi-4-cartoon-collections) [Functions, Loops, Enumerate, String Methods, List Methods] There are three functions to complete in this lab:

+ Dwarf Roll Call with Snow White's vertically-challenged friends
+ Summon Captain Planet and Long Planeteer Calls with the environmentally conscious hero

[STRETCH: Mario Pyramids](https://github.com/google-cssi/cssi-4-python-group-mario-stretch-lab)
[Functions, Loops, Console Input, Conditional Statements] Toward the beginning of World 1-1 in Nintendoâ€™s Super Mario Brothers, Mario must hop over two "half-pyramids" of blocks as he heads toward a flag pole. Below is a screenshot.

Your mission is to recreate these blocks using python. You will add parameters so that the user can specify the height of each pyramid and eventually chain pyramids together.
